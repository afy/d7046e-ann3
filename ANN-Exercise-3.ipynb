    "# Convolution in Neural Networks\n",
    "A convolutional neural network, CNN for short, is a type of ANN that consists of at least one convolutional layer. CNN's are often used where the input size may vary such as when we are dealing with image input. The architecture of CNNs was inspired by how the visual cortex functions in our brain.\n",

    "## Task 1: Implement convolution\n",
    "Implement 2d same convolution without using a built-in convolution function. This should function as described in [this blog post](https://jcbgamboa.github.io/2017/08/12/what-are-convolutions/). One of the great strengths of convolution is that it functions on any sized image, hence it is important that your implementation also does. Same convolution means that the dimensions of the output are the same as the dimensions of the input. This is achieved by padding the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have implemented a function that performs 2d convolution, use that to perform convolution over all channels in this image. Show the result using 3 different filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the padding needed to get the input to be the same space as the output you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n_{out} = \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n_{in}+2p-k}{s} \\right \\rfloor+1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_{out}$ is the number of output features, $n_{in}$ is the number of input features, $k$ is the kernel size, $p$ is the padding size and $s$ is the stride size. You can assume that the stride is always 1."

    "Transfer learning refers to the practice to use a model which has already been pre-trained on a large dataset to be able to solve task $T_1$, replace the output layer or a few of the upper layers within this model and retrain the model on a smaller dataset to be able to solve task $T_2$. Formally this can be described as the following:\n",

    "__Def 1:__ Let $D_s$ be the source domain and $T_s$ be the corresponding source task. Let $D_t$ be the target domain and $T_t$ be the corresponding target task. Let $f_t$ be the predictive function for $T_s$. Thus transfer learning aims to improve the learning of $f_t$ in $D_t$ using the already learned knowledge in $D_s$ and $T_s$ where $D_s \\neq D_t$ and $T_s \\neq T_t$.\n",

    "## Fine-tuning and Feature extraction\n",
    "There are two main ideas when it comes to transfer learning, fine-tuning and feature extraction. When using fine-tuning we allow all weights to be changed during the training phase. However, when we use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor we instead freeze earlier layers of the model, which means that the weights in those layers will not be updated during the training phase and we only update the weights in the upper layers that we have replaced. \n",

This is what the early layers are optimized to do, where later layers extract more abstract features relevant for the task. \n",
